im thinking i should revamp the site...

I got a programming job, Jr Backend developer for Abe AI

Finally!

I'm really excited to grow as a developer. I'll be flying high before you know it.

The pay raise is nice, it hasn't really hit me yet. But that's not the point.

I'm just excited to finally be doing what I love for a living.

I'm going to get so good, you have no idea.

-------------

I have a few ideas for websites, I just bought rotationcomics.com
Hopefully that happens soon.

I made a proof of concept here <a href=https://github.com/doctorMcbob/hermes>I'm calling it hermes</a>
it's a socket server built into a python generator

Thanks for reading,
