Wow my very first blog entry. I wonder how I'll look back at this.

I'm still figuring out how I want the blog to work on the backend.

Right now I'm saving the blog entry as MMDDYY.txt in a folder called 'blogs'

I'll load them with python, and put links up for each blog post.

How will I handle images and such, I wonder.

How fun!

I transcribed my cellular automata from python to javascript for the site.
Pretty fun, and nice to have a link to share with people. Im going to keep working on it.

I'd like to add a 'rule builder' of some sort. With a graphic visual for all 256 permutations...
It will be pretty big...

I also need to write a loader, shouldn't be too hard. Not sure if I'll do it on the front end or back end.
maybe automata/[somerule] will load a rule so you can send someone a rule.

I just moved the site to my home server! No more AWS, you're in my house right now.

It's pretty old parts, the processor was only 35 dollars...

What a fun project. I'm brainstorming some more javascript projects to whip up on here.

Thanks for reading nerds.

Its been a while!

I decided to finally add a rule builder to the cellular automata on the cite.

I also finally added a rule loader to go along with it.

I really should add some documentation, but for now I'm happy with just a functional tool to play with.

I have more fun stuff for the site coming through the pipeline, Im transcribing my <a href="https://github.com/doctorMcbob/mazes/">maze algorithm</a> into javascript. Its gonna to be great.

Thanks for reading, whoever you are.

im thinking i should revamp the site...

I got a programming job, Jr Backend developer for Abe AI

Finally!

I'm really excited to grow as a developer. I'll be flying high before you know it.

The pay raise is nice, it hasn't really hit me yet. But that's not the point.

I'm just excited to finally be doing what I love for a living.

I'm going to get so good, you have no idea.

-------------

I have a few ideas for websites, I just bought rotationcomics.com
Hopefully that happens soon.

I made a proof of concept here <a href=https://github.com/doctorMcbob/hermes>I'm calling it hermes</a>
it's a socket server built into a python generator

Yes I know the blogs are out of order. Im going to redo this i swear.

I just added a pretty cool feature to the site, a javascript Life Like cellular automata builder.
<a href="/lifelike">check it out</a>

I originally made this as an NFT but I kindof stepped out of that game,
I sold all my crypto for about 2 grand. A pretty good gain for just goofing around.

Hoping to do more for the site soon, we'll see.

Thanks for reading nerds, please check out the life like builder!
