Yes I know the blogs are out of order. Im going to redo this i swear.

I just added a pretty cool feature to the site, a javascript Life Like cellular automata builder.
<a href="/lifelike">check it out</a>

I originally made this as an NFT but I kindof stepped out of that game,
I sold all my crypto for about 2 grand. A pretty good gain for just goofing around.

Hoping to do more for the site soon, we'll see.

Thanks for reading nerds, please check out the life like builder!
