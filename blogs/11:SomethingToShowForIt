<h3>Red Pants Deluxe 2 Update</h3>
As of when I wrote this I have been re writing the games engine in C which as it turns out is hard.
Once its done my game will no longer qualify as a virus and it will no longer be eligable for the top 10 viruses of the year award, so I will unfortunately not be entering.

Its a daunting amount of work, but it isn't very much code.
Its going to be a wild ride, and ill see you on the other side.

Anyways for those of you who arent fucking idiots and actually give a shit which is less then 0 more like a hundredth of a zero (if you know what im fucking talking about (thats whats up) )

I've been learning so much with C its really been a blast
I have the sprites module done and the inputs module done

Next I have Actors Worlds, Frames,
Boxes(hit/hurt) and then finally Scripts

I really have to take my time and think through the details from the top before i dive into a lot of this.

I am thinking about what types of tokens are fundementally important to the scripting language.
There is a lot of loosey goosey data typing I have to deal with.

I am probably going to have some sort of union type that will stand in for a red pants script token (patent pending)

Anyways, my head has been all over the place so this project has been some much needed cold dry caluclation, cheers.
