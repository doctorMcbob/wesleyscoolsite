Wow my very first blog entry. I wonder how I'll look back at this.

I'm still figuring out how I want the blog to work on the backend.

Right now I'm saving the blog entry as MMDDYY.txt in a folder called 'blogs'

I'll load them with python, and put links up for each blog post.

How will I handle images and such, I wonder.

How fun!
