<h3> A Tale as Old as the Time it Took to Tell the Tale </h3>

<p>
Im working on a fighting game. its coming along, you can check it out <a href="https://www.github.com/doctorMcbob/superFightPunch"> on my github </a>
Im going to need pixel artists. It takes me a long time  to do the spritesheets.
In a moment of inspiration I want to be getting ideas into code and pixel art can be a huge bottleneck.
I will probably outsource the work to my friends.

The wild west is over kids, the internet isn't cool anymore.

whats cool now is <a href="http://nedroid.com/2008/06/beartato-86/">black light tattoos of snakes and knifes</a>

I spend a lot of time thinking about the modern technological landscape. we live in a time of kings.
If you spend 14 hours watching youtube you basically just put in a shift at google. they made money. you should get some of that money.
It was a game changer when youtube even started paying its creators. Now lets start paying for engagement.
We need technology to support us, not eat us alive. The companies can afford it.
It would dramatically change the incentives for the better. I speculate this would accelerate technology.

What a horrifying vision of the future.
