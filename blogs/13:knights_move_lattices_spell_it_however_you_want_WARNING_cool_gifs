~~~ --- A Quick Note --- ~~~

Lichess might be the best story in open source.

Lets consider Lichess vs Chess Com

            Lichess   |  Chess Com
          ------------+--------------
             Free     | Free to play (ew)
           Beautiful  |  Branding everywhere
            Real API  | No Real API (there exists a fan documentation)
          Open Source | Ha Ha Ha Absolutely Not
  Teaches Ad Blockers |  Sells Out
        Free Puzzles  | Paywall
    Open Free Studies | Paywall
        No Duck Chess |  Duck Chess

if it wasn't for duck chess I wouldn't have an account

Lichess is so much better then chess com

<h1>The Knight Sure Is Tricky Eh?</h1>

Behold. 12 x 13

<h1>What Am I Even Looking At?</h1>

Consider the knight in chess. He moves One square across an axis and Two squares across the other.
<br>
1 x 2
<img src="/static/img/1_2.png" width="50%">
<br>
This image is charting the knights moves. The center is black. Every knight move from there is a different color.
<br>
For example, ONE knight move away is one color. TWO knight moves away is another color. THREE knight moves is another... and so on.
<br>
So what if the knight didnt move in One by Two? What if he moved Two by Three?
<br>
2 x 3
<img src="/static/img/2_3.png" width="50%">
<br>
3 x 4
<img src="/static/img/3_4.png" width="50%">
<br>
<h1>Yeah cut to the chase and post the gifs we get it</h1>
The following is what happens when you increase the knight move by one every iteration
(I only charted 200 moves)

<br>
The following is what happens when you keep the first number as a 2 and let the second number be increasing subsequent prime numbers.

<h1> Okay so why does it look like that? </h1>
Hey man beats me.
