<p>
This is actually the 2nd game in a trilogy. <!-- Actually its the third of a quadalogy -->

The first game in the modern Red Pants trilogy I made in four days all while taking a train from New York City back to my home in Seattle. 
SuperRedPants (turbo) : By far the most janky game I have ever created, but still finished it. I say that with love. 
<!-- 
I fucking love super red pants turbo. I tried to put in something like P speed ie mario world
but it came out fucking WONKy to the maximum degree.
-->
The second game, has made its way to itch.io. Also a game jam, this time I had taken a week off work during AGDQ in 2020 pre pandemic.
RedPantsAdventure : Solid, jump feels natural, power up hats make for fun levels.
<!--
the original red pants game was my senior project in high school.
it was three levels, insanely easy and unbelievably poorly programmed. 
it did a third of the things that super red pants turbo does with ten thousand times the amount of code.

But hey, a boy can dream.
-->

The third game, well, thats not finished yet.
RedPantsOrDieTrying : Not completed, havent worked on in many months. Improvements to the platforming make this the best red pants game by far, incomplete as it is.

<!--
Yeah thats right bucko, a cliffhanger.

<h3> Spoilers </h3>
<p>
The story in Red Pants Adventure follows a bald progatonist, as he runs along, wailing his arms behind him through different areas collecting cheese.
The game ends and shares its in game timer once the strange bald man collects the biggest cheese. He then smirks and does a cool pose with his cheese.
</p>
<h3> Thus Concludes the spoiler section of the blog post </h3>

<p>
Overall I am very happy with the project. The code is a hot mess. The soundtrack was thrown together in a couple of hours.
But hey, who wants to worry about it. I've been sitting on this game for 2 years. 
</p>

<p>
Lets be honest, if you're reading my blog, you should just play the game.
