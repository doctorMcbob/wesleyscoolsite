I transcribed my cellular automata from python to javascript for the site.
Pretty fun, and nice to have a link to share with people. Im going to keep working on it.

I'd like to add a 'rule builder' of some sort. With a graphic visual for all 256 permutations...
It will be pretty big...

I also need to write a loader, shouldn't be too hard. Not sure if I'll do it on the front end or back end.
maybe automata/[somerule] will load a rule so you can send someone a rule.
