I've finally done it. I put a stamp on something and released it.

So, where to begin. This game, which I will discuss in a moment, comes with a little bit of context
that I am sure you are dying to read about. My friends and I have had a tradition of one of us designing
a christmas themed table top role playing game, and the rest of us all playing it. My friend John did it
one year, Emory did it a few times, Isaac doing it last time we did it, pre pandemic.
The last refrence to the canon of the Christmas RPG universe was a letter in the mail from the Haribo gummy bear factory,
saying that they had santa captured or something, they were going to bring him back to life?
I dont remember, anyways thats why theres gummy bears.
This is half of the context.

Another random creative tradition we take is drawing comics. We have a bizzare strategy we like to call "Rotation Comics"
where we pass the pages around. You draw one panel and pass. Since we all always start with a different idea for each page,
the challenge is making one page lead into the next page. The result is usually an insane, hard to follow, deus ex machina filled
mess that reads like a 4 year old came up with it. Its pretty awesome.
Anyways, there is a cannon in these comics that includes some characters, Herfy the horse, Beefer the bear, and Swankers the cat
being the main three. These characters of course are the characters in the game.

So, the game itself. From a programming perspective, I am very happy with the project. The engine is very small, infinitely extensible,
capable of a much more interesting game I may or may not eventually make. Its just a lot of drawing.
If you draw and you want to make a point and click adventure, let me know.

The story, to summarize, the player is a nihilistic child who cares about nothing in life, has no morals, and only cares about consuming
gummy bears. His obsession with reckless sugar brings him into the world of organized crime. By the end of the game, he has gone through
extensive character development and has truely come to terms with what he has done, and worse, what he has to do.

You gather gummy bear wrappers.
One you are given by some stupid kid in a playground you never go back to who is never refrenced again. 
The second, you get from Herfy the horse after giving him steriods so he can win the race.
The third, you get from Swankers the cat after you help him crack the code to break into the bank.
The fourth and final, you get from Beefer the bear's nightclub after giving the bouncer a fake ID.

After that, you fly to the north pole, and I wont spoil what you have to do there. But I will tell you this...
