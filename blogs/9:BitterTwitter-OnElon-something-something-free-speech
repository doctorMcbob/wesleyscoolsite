<h3>Richest Man In The World Spends 40 Billion Dollars To Be An Internet Forum Moderator</h3>

<p>
my apologies to those of you who somehow give a shit

Elon Musk buys Twitter

this dude really said this, this is an actual quote:
"""
Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy,
and Twitter is the digital town square where matters
of the future of humanity are debated.
"""

let me give you a second for your eyes to roll back into their normal position,

I dont know who needs to hear this...
<h1>Twitter is not the backbone of all human interaction!</h1>
<h1>This is not the ultimate battle between good and evil!</h1>
<h1>as it turns out, twitter is just another internet forum!</h1>

Big money Elon is the equivalent of the guy on IRC saying "hey can you guys make me a mod"
</p>

<p>
if you think twitter is so important to modern life that you think it should be treated like a public utility...
if you think twitter moderation is important to the future of humanity...
or if you think that this is a 'big win' for some side of politics...
you should probably delete your twitter account.
</p>

<p>
twitter is the most
self indulgent,
self important,
masturbatory,
hatred gratifying
chamber of doom

DELETE YOUR TWITTER if you care so goddamn much
its really not that big a deal.

<h3> Elon Musk, The Most Important Man In The Universe </h3>
<p>
Elon Musk is the most incredible example of someone who thinks they are an anime protagonist.

This guy really thinks that he alone can save the world.

"We're going to Mars"
"Electric cars are gonna save the world"
"I'm gonna build a big ass tunnel cause nobody else thought of that"

Look Elon, I get it, the governments across the world are largely incompetent and not up to solving any real tasks.
That does not mean the world is looking to YOU to solve them.
YOU arent that important Elon, all YOU do is invest money. YOU're not an engineer.

He spends so much time jacking off on twitter that he really just decided
"I, Elon Musk, will step up to the plate to SAVE twitter, the most important
space for inteligent discussion on the planet where the MOST IMPORTANT topics are debated"

the only thing deeper than this mans pockets is his ego.
</p>
<p>
Look, in principle i agree that free speech is important. 
I even think that some change in leadership at twitter could be a good thing.

but this guy? did it have to be this guy?
whatever dude, dont just delete the app, delete your account.
</p>
<p>
fuck reddit too
